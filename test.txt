This is the test text for csfifty-> pset six -> mispellings.

I am just writing a few short sentences and then adding most of the words in this file into DICTIONARY.

The dictionary file was completely blank after running make.  It appears that i am either unable to 
download the csfifty dictionaries, or more likely, I am not coding that part of my program correctly.  

This concludes the test text.
